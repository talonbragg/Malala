    <h1>Theme of <div class="title"><strong>I am Malala</strong></div></h1>
      <p>The theme of this story is mainly, <strong>appreciate what you have and the importance of education.</strong> I will show this with two quotes from the book.</p>
      <p class='box'>"I wasn't sad. I wasn't scared. I just thought: It doesn't matter what I look like. I am alive. I was thankful"(Yousafzai 145).</p>
      <p>This shows that she didn't care what happened when she got shot, she is fine with it and will move on because the past is in the past.</p>
      <p class="box">"'Please bring my schoolbag,' I begged. 'Exams are coming up.'"</p>
      <p>This evidence shows the importance of education because even when she had just gotten shot, she is still thinking about education.</p>
